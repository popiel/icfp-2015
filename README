Thanks go to Aetheric Worlds, Inc. for sponsoring me for this contest.  Whee!

There's nothing particularly exciting here; I had too many issues chasing
down bugs to get very far.  In particular, my attempts at tiling are horrific.

Different behaviours are controlled by setting flags via the command line;
in particular, the bottom-filling behaviours are controlled with the
-depth # and -d t flags.  -d is actually a collection of binary toggles,
mostly flipping on bits of debug output.

I'm not high enough in the ranks for it to matter that I don't have the best
algorithms as default.  My latest submissions were via "-depth 1 -d ts" or
"-depth 1 -d s", depending on the problem.

I'm pretty sure that the longest power phrase is
"Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn!"
but I was never organized enough to try to generate it in a real submission.

Oh, and I wrote it all in Scala.  I've been using that at work a lot lately,
so it was easier.  However, I never got organized enough to use the async
features in my code, so it's all single threaded.  *sigh*

That's all, folks.
